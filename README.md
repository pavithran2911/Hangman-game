# Hangman Game

A simple text-based implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python.

## Description

This Python program allows you to play the Hangman game against the computer. The computer selects a random word from a predefined list, and your task is to guess the word letter by letter. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly before running out of chances.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the game files are located.

3. Run the game by executing the following command:

4. The game will start, and you will be presented with a series of underscores representing the letters in the word to guess. You can start guessing letters by entering them one at a time.

5. You have a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses before the game ends. If you guess all the letters correctly within the given attempts, you win the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (No additional libraries or packages are required)

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the `word_list` variable in the `hangman.py` file. Add or remove words from the list to change the possible words the computer can choose.
